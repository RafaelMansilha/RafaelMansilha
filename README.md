Hi! I don't know how the hell you get here, but welcome!

I'm currently finishing a master's degree in computational systems modeling :mortar_board::disappointed_relieved:, and I've been working with web development for 7 years at the Federal University of Tocantins. After finishing the master's degree, I'll be looking for new challenges :eyes: (Including a cuter profile, I think I'll do something aimed at an RPG sheet :crystal_ball:).

Want to see me talking nonsense in Portuguese? Follow me on twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rafaelmansilha"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12387389/157924939-8371d7fb-03aa-4136-9fc2-c1741babe5f1.png" alt="drawing" width="25"/> @RafaelMansilha</a>
